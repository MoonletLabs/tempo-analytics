TEMPO ANALYTICS DASHBOARD - FEATURE SUMMARY
===========================================

OVERVIEW
--------

The Tempo Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive real-time analytics platform for monitoring the Tempo Network (Testnet - Moderato). It provides deep insights into network activity, memo transfers, fee payments, compliance events, and Fee AMM pool health. The dashboard is designed to give users a complete picture of network operations through intuitive visualizations and detailed data exploration tools.

The live dashboard is available at: https://tempo.moonlet.dev/


CORE FEATURES
=============

1. ANALYTICS DASHBOARD TAB
---------------------------

The Analytics Dashboard is the heart of the platform, presenting a comprehensive overview of network activity through key metrics and visualizations.

Key Metrics

The dashboard features eight primary metric cards that provide at-a-glance insights into network health and activity. These include:

• Total Transfers - Counts all token transfers within the time window
• Memo Transfers - Tracks transfers that include memo fields using the TIP-20 transferWithMemo function
• Unique Memos - Shows the number of distinct memo identifiers being used across the network
• Fee Payments - Counts all payments made to the FeeManager contract
• Unique Fee Payers - Shows how many distinct addresses are participating in fee payments
• Sponsored Fees - Displays the percentage of fee payments where the payer is different from the transaction sender, indicating third-party fee sponsorship activity
• Compliance Events - Tracks all TIP-403 registry events
• Block Range - Shows the current block range being analyzed

All metrics include delta indicators that show changes from the previous data load, allowing users to quickly identify trends and changes in network activity.

Payments Funnel

A dedicated breakdown table provides a clear view of the payment flow through the network. It shows the progression from Total Transfers to Memo Transfers, displaying the coverage percentage that indicates how much of the network activity includes memo fields. The funnel then shows the transition from Memo Transfers to Sponsored Fee Transfers, displaying the sponsorship rate that reveals how often fees are being paid by parties other than the transaction sender.

Visualizations

The dashboard includes over fifteen different charts and visualizations, organized into several categories:

Counterparty Analysis
• Top Counterparties (Senders) - Bar charts ranking addresses by memo transfer volume
• Top Counterparties (Receivers) - Bar charts ranking addresses by memo transfer volume

Token Analytics
• Token Dominance - Pie chart showing the share of memoed volume by each token
• Memo Transfer Volume By Token - Bar chart with visual token icons
• Fees Paid By Token - Pie chart showing fee distribution across different tokens
• Fee Demand vs Pool Reserves - Bar chart comparing fee demand to AMM liquidity with automatic alerts when liquidity is running low

Memo Analytics
• Top Memos By Count - Bar chart showing which memo identifiers are used most frequently
• Memo Reuse Distribution - Histogram revealing memo reuse patterns (1 use, 2-5 uses, 6-20 uses, or 21+ uses)
• Memo Concentration (Pareto) - Line chart showing the cumulative share of activity by the top N memos

Fee Analytics
• Top Fee Payers - Bar chart displaying addresses paying the most fees with Top10 concentration percentage
• Fees Over Time - Stacked area chart showing fee payments over time, broken down by token
• Sponsorship Split - Pie chart visualizing the proportion of sponsored versus self-paid fees
• Top Fee Payments - Bar chart showing a sample of recent fee payment events

Compliance Analytics
• Compliance Events Over Time - Stacked bar chart showing different event types over time (PolicyCreated, PolicyAdminUpdated, WhitelistUpdated, BlacklistUpdated)
• Top Compliance Updaters - Bar chart identifying which addresses are making the most policy changes
• Most Changed Policies - Bar chart showing which policy IDs are being updated most frequently

Activity and Liquidity
• Activity Over Time - Multi-line chart simultaneously displaying memos, fees, and policies over time
• Fee AMM Total Liquidity - Bar chart showing the sum of pool reserves by token


2. DATA EXPLORER TAB
--------------------

The Data Explorer tab provides detailed, paginated tables for users who need to examine specific transactions and events in detail.

Fee Paid Summary

At the top of the Data Explorer, a badge display shows the total fees paid per token to the FeeManager contract, providing a quick reference for fee distribution across different tokens.

Data Tables

The Data Explorer includes three comprehensive tables with full pagination support, each showing 25 rows per page:

Recent Memo Transfers Table
• Displays all recent memo transfers with transaction details
• Each row includes: transaction timestamp, token information with visual icons, transfer amount, sender and receiver addresses, memo field, and transaction hash link
• Clickable rows navigate to Memo Explorer with memo field pre-filled
• All transaction hashes link directly to Tempo Explorer for detailed transaction information
• Quick access button provides immediate navigation to the Memo Explorer tab

Recent Compliance Events Table
• Provides detailed information about all TIP-403 registry activity
• Each event displays: timestamp, event type with color-coded badges, policy ID, and transaction hash link
• Event types tracked include PolicyCreated, PolicyAdminUpdated, WhitelistUpdated, and BlacklistUpdated
• Complete visibility into compliance policy changes on the network

Fee AMM Pools Table
• Displays all active pools in the Fee AMM system
• Shows relationship between user tokens and validator tokens with their respective reserves
• Columns include: User Token, Validator Token, User Reserve, and Validator Reserve
• Complete transparency into the liquidity structure of the fee AMM


3. MEMO EXPLORER TAB
--------------------

The Memo Explorer provides specialized functionality for searching and analyzing specific memo identifiers across the network.

Memo Search

The search interface features a dedicated input field that accepts bytes32 memo values in hexadecimal format, requiring exactly 66 characters (0x prefix plus 64 hex characters). The system provides real-time validation to ensure the memo format is correct before allowing a search. When a search is initiated, the interface provides clear loading feedback and comprehensive error handling to guide users through the process.

Search Results

Once results are found, they are displayed in a paginated table format showing 25 results per page. Each entry includes:
• Transaction timestamp
• Token information with visual icons
• Transfer amount
• Sender and receiver addresses
• Memo field
• Direct link to the transaction hash on Tempo Explorer for detailed inspection

The results count is prominently displayed, giving users immediate feedback on how many transactions match their search criteria, making it easy to track down all transfers associated with a specific memo identifier.


BACKEND API ENDPOINTS
